# Overview

This project is a modular, plugin-based system built on top of Pyrogram, providing the ability to handle various scenarios through custom plugins and handlers. The bot allows for the dynamic loading, unloading, and updating of modules, as well as customization through a `.env` configuration file.

## Key Features

- **Modular system**: Allows for easy integration and management of custom modules (plugins).
- **Scenario-based message handling**: Customizable message scenarios can be created by extending the base class.
- **Dynamic module management**: Download, load, and unload modules on the fly.
- **.env file configuration**: Environment variables are managed via a `.env` file.

## Additional Notes

- **Logging**: The bot uses Pythonâ€™s `logging` module to provide detailed logs. You can configure log levels via the `.env` file.
- **Pyrogram**: The bot heavily relies on the Pyrogram library for interacting with Telegram's API. Make sure to consult the [Pyrogram documentation](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) if needed.
